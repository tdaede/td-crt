// that section over a certain fraction of the total time.
// This makes the assumption that the beam has to pass through zero to reach both
// of these sides, e.g. that the scan is covering at least the area of the threshold.

// There will be no fault reported until a minimum of WINDOW samples to prevent
// tripping on startup.
