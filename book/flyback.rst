Flyback
=======

The flyback transformer has been heavily optimized through half a century of TV construction, and most TVs have settled on the same flyback design.

At its heart the flyback is a transformer just like any other used in high frequency switching supplies, such as a cell phone charger.

The primary winding is generally wound to operate at B+ voltage (80-200V). One side of the primary must tolerate up to 1500V, as it is connected directly to the HOT.

The EHT secondary is wound out of very fine wire, with a plastic preform splitting it into lower voltage sections. All windings are potted inside a molded plastic case with a distinctive shape.

The magnetic core is a ferrite C core, constructed in two halves and installed after the rest of the flyback is complete. The two halves are held together with a steel clamp.

A rectification diode is included inside the flyback packaging, allowing DC HV to exit. Sometimes, capacitance may be present, but most of the time it is provided by the tube itself.

Two additional high voltage outputs are provided - focus (4-8kV) and screen (300-1kV). These are adjustable via potentiometers (as the current is extremely low), either sourced from the EHT output or from separate taps on the secondary winding.

The high voltage connections are normally permanently wired, however in rare cases there may be connectors for any of the 3 outputs. On some Sony flybacks, the EHT can be disconnected by pushing the wire in, then rotating 90 degrees.

Tertiary windings are common, in particular for heater voltage (6.3Vrms), logic supplies, and vertical amplifier power.
