Neck board
==========

On most designs, the neck board has the CRT socket, high voltage connections, lower voltage power connections, one or more CRT frame grounds, spark gap overvoltage protection, and the final stage of RGB amplification.

Protection is normally provided on screen and the 3 cathodes. For low voltages, MOVs may be used. Neon bulbs may be substituted for proper spark gaps to save cost.

The final stage of RGB amplification can be either class A or AB. Class A is normally used on lower current tubes or tubes which require less bandwidth. Class AB is used when class A cannot achieve the required bandwidth without excessive power consumption. On class AB amplifiers, typically the largest transistors and resistors are not from the push-pull output stage, but rather the class A stage before it to drive the final stage transistors and provide correct AB biasing.

The neck board may be AC or DC coupled. If AC coupled, a clamp signal is provided and a final stage clamp is performed, to ensure minimal bias drift.

A blanking signal may also be provided, which is simply used bring the black level further down during blanking intervals.

Heater ground is usually, but not always, shared with signal grounds.

Screen usually attaches to the PCB, but may have cutouts in order to prvent arc tracking.

Focus almost always enters the neck connector directly under a snapped on cover, never being routed through the PCB.
