CRT Yoke
========

The CRT yoke consists primarily of two coils, the horizontal and vertical deflection coils. These are normally wound on a plastic frame that is slid onto the CRT neck and held in place by a screw clamp. The yoke is pushed against the CRT via rubber wedges, to protect the delicate windings and take up thermal expansion.

The horizontal coil is normally wound on the inside as axial flux coils. The shape of the horizontal deflection coil is critical, as electronic geometry adjustments to horizontal deflection are difficult. Also, because of the high bandwidth needed by the horizontal deflection circuit, inductance needs to be minimized, while sensitivity needs to be maximized. The horizontal deflection coils are surrounded by a ferrite ring that completes the magnetic path for the horizontal deflection, while having low loss at the horizontal line frequency.

Because the horizontal coil typically has high voltages across it (usually up to 1500V), the winding techniquie is important. The neck area is clear of aquadag, and the top and bottom coils are wound in series in order to reduce the voltage across a single coil. In addition, dedicated paths are usually molded into the yoke's plastic frame for the magnet wire to travel to its termination point.

The vertical coil is normally wound toroidal-style, on the same ferrite used to complete the horizontal magnetic path. The top and bottom coils are wound in opposing directions, forcing a flux path through the yoke. Winding pattern on these matters much less, as vertical is easier to correct, and the flux pattern is largely defined by the ferrite geometry.

On the rear of the yoke is are the purity and convergence controls, usually a set of adjustable permanent ferrite magnets. On some yokes, the adjustable magnets are replaced by a single ferrite disc which has its magnetic field programmed at the factory. Because it is impossible to adjust after the fact, these yokes are bonded on to the CRT to ensure that they remain aligned.

Additional correction windings may be present on the horizontal or vertical circuits, or a transformer may be used to couple correction waveforms between the horizontal and vertical circuits.

A rotation coil may be present, for electronically adjustable rotation adjustment.

The yoke normally has a termination PCB that connects the magnet wire to applance wire. The vertical voltage is low, allowing use of wire insulation such as UL 1015. The horizontal yoke (in particular, the HOT side) experiences much higher voltages, requiring usage of e.g. UL 1032 class wire.

"Wafer" style connectors are used to connect the yoke to the PCB.
